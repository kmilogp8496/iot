All drizzle schemas must be registered on [drizzle.ts](mdc:server/utils/drizzle.ts).
Every schema must be added inside of `server/database/schemas`. Before creating a new schema always take a look at the rest of the implementations in the `server/database/schemas` for guidance. The relations between the schemas must be always added when specified or it's obvious. The dialect for the schemas will always be SQLite.
